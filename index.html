    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello my name is Dioris Diaz I am currently a Operations Manager for a company 
        that is based in Philadelphia called GoBrands or its better known name Gopuff.
        I've been working for Gopuff for about a year and a half now, I started as a delivery driver
        for the company and quickly moved up the ranks and I am now one of the lead managers 
        of the North-East branch of Gopuff. Aside from working as an Ops manager I am also currently 
        enrolled in the UPenn LPS Coding BootCamp. I believe that being able to code/programming 
        is a on of the most useful skills that you can learn in this day in age especially with the rise 
        of automation and the advances in technology.
