         <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p>
        Hello my name is Dioris Diaz I am currently an Operations Manager for a company 
        that is based in Philadelphia called GoBrands or its better known name Gopuff.
        I've been working for Gopuff for about a year and a half now, I started as a delivery driver
        for the company and quickly moved up the ranks and I am now one of the lead managers 
        of the North-East branch of Gopuff. Aside from working as an Ops manager I am also currently 
        enrolled in the UPenn LPS Coding BootCamp. I believe that being able to code/programming 
        is a on of the most useful skills that you can learn in this day in age especially with the rise 
        of automation and the advances in technology. One of my other intersest is music, I've been
        playing the guitar since I was a child. I find that its very therapeutic and also extremely fun.
        I would like to eventually somehow integrate my musical abillties with the coding knowledge that 
        I am gaining.
